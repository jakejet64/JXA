# JXA & AppleScript snippets that I utilized to fix MacOS

---

##### I *love* my Macbook.

>I love the best in class display
>I love the amazing battery life
>I love the best Trackpad on earth
>I love the integration with my iPhone
>I love the speakers that make you go "Woah, that's from a laptop?"
>*...I can go on*
><br>
>Now... MacOS? ðŸ¥²

<br>

I took on some file organizing one day.

<br>

My frustration with MacOS Window Management finally got the best of me that day. After trying out the Stage Manager feature and seeing that it only had half of the functionality that it should (No way to lock/save/rename sets), I finally took the plunge into the MacOS Shortcuts rabbithole.

*This repository & the following shortcuts are the masterpiece that resulted.*

## Extra Resources

```
Chrome User Pro-tip:

Have a resource you really like? (or website you frequent)

Make it an app!

1. Three Dot Menu > More Tools > Create Shortcut...
2. Check 'Open as Window'
3. Drag resulting .app file into your Applications folder
   (to make it accessible to Spotlight, Alfred, etc.)

I've started to do this with all major resources
that I use, not only does it help immensely with
application shortcuts to everything I could need,
it also goes a long way with keeping Chrome Tabs
 & Windows to a minimum.

#### Documentation

>[Apple Official Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/MacAutomationScriptingGuide/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016239-CH56-SW1)

>[Scripting with JXA](https://bru6.de/jxa/#structure-of-the-site)
>By far the most complete & concise resource that I came across, and trust me, there were a LOT of them. Even goes into JXA vs. AppleScript capabilities.

#### Tools

>Apple [**Shortcuts** (user guide)](https://support.apple.com/en-hk/guide/shortcuts-mac/apdf22b0444c/mac)
>If you're happy with the functionality demonstrated above, this is all you really need.

>Apple [**Script Editor** (user guide)](https://support.apple.com/en-hk/guide/script-editor/welcome/mac)
>This is a barebones program provided with MacOS to write scripts. I found it a lot more informative to debug with than the JXA Shortcut Block, at times the Window > Dictionary was helpful, but if you plan on using the next two tools you can ignore it's existence.

>[**Visual Studio Code** (website)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) & [**AppleScript Extension** (marketplace extension link)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=idleberg.applescript)
>You're on Github so I'm going to assume you know the first one, and the extension is just to add support for JXA & AppleScript. This is where I worked on all JXA snippets as soon as I found the extension, before giving it one last test with Shortcuts.

>[**Script Debugger** (download page)](https://latenightsw.com/sd8/download/)
>Most advanced tool there is for this type of work, unfortunately only works with AppleScript & I was much more comfortable working with JXA. Still helpful with debugging, giving you view of all your currnt application data in a tree to play with.
